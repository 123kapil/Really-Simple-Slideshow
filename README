Really Simple™ Slideshow
========================

Yet another slideshow plugin for jQuery! This particular one loads images dynamically, as and when they're required by the slideshow, allowing you to create larger slideshows without having to pre-load all of the images.

Include rsf-slideshow-1.0.js in your document, then initialise a slideshow like this:

$('#my-slidshow-div').rsfSlideshow();

Please see docs for information about adding slides, and the correct HTML markup.
