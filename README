Really Simple(TM) Slideshow
===========================

Yet another slideshow plugin for jQuery! This particular one loads images dynamically, as and when they're required by the slideshow, allowing you to create larger slideshows without having to pre-load all of the images.

Include rsf-slideshow-1.0.js in your document, then initialise a slideshow like this:

$('#my-slidshow-div').rsfSlideshow();

Please see docs for information about adding slides, and the correct HTML markup.

Change Log
==========

Version 1.1 -- 18 Apr 2011
--------------------------
* Changed the name of the plugin file to jquery.rs.slideshow.js to bring it into line with jQuery plugin naming convention.
* Bug fix: More consistent behaviour across browsers when loading cached images into a slideshow.
* Changes to the default markup used for specifying slide data. Markup now makes more sense semantically, and offers the opportunity to allow non-JavaScript users to click on links to slideshow images. (Extra CSS is required to do this, and we'll publish this soon).
* slide_data_selectors option added. This makes slide data more customisable.
* url_data_selector option removed (replaced by slide_data_selectors).
* caption_data_selector option removed (replaced by slide_data_selectors).
* link_url_data_selector option removed (replaced by slide_data_selectors).
* effect_data_selector option removed (replaced by slide_data_selectors).
