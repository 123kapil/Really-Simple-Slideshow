Really Simple(TM) Slideshow
===========================

Yet another slideshow plugin for jQuery! This particular one loads images dynamically, as and when they're required by the slideshow, allowing you to create larger slideshows without having to pre-load all of the images.

Include rsf-slideshow-1.0.js in your document, then initialise a slideshow like this:

$('#my-slidshow-div').rsfSlideshow();

Please see docs for information about adding slides, and the correct HTML markup.

Change Log
==========

Version 1.3.1 -- 2 May 2011
---------------------------
* Fixed image size detection bug when resizing images using CSS.
* Fixed bug causing controls to be auto-generated regardless of settings.
* Private methods are no longer available publicly
* Moved all default options to $.rsfSlideshow.defaults

Version 1.3 -- 1 May 2011
-------------------------
* Added the controls option.
* Changed the name of the eventCallbacks option to eventHandlers.
* Changed the behaviour of the following methods: bindPlayPause, bindPreviousSlide, bindNextSlide and bindIndex so that they require jQuery objects to bind the behaviours to.
* Changed the name of the bindNext method to bindNextSlide.
* Changed the name of the bindPrevious method to bindPreviousSlide.
* Removed the following options: play_pause_class, prev_class, next_class, stop_on_prev_next, index_class and stop_on_index.
* Added auto-generation of control elements.

Version 1.2 -- 27 Apr 2011
--------------------------
* Added bindIndex() method as a quick way to create "go to slide..." control functionality.
* Added bindPrevious() and bindNext() methods as a quick way to create prev/next control functionality.
* Added bindPlayPause() method as a quick way to create play/pause control functionality.
* Added default event callbacks to options, to aid with setup of global slideshow functionality.
* Added $.rsfSlideshow() method for setting options globally.
* Added event triggers for slideshow events. 

Version 1.1 -- 18 Apr 2011
--------------------------
* Changed the name of the plugin file to jquery.rs.slideshow.js to bring it into line with jQuery plugin naming convention.
* Bug fix: More consistent behaviour across browsers when loading cached images into a slideshow.
* Changes to the default markup used for specifying slide data. Markup now makes more sense semantically, and offers the opportunity to allow non-JavaScript users to click on links to slideshow images. (Extra CSS is required to do this, and we'll publish this soon).
* slide_data_selectors option added. This makes slide data more customisable.
* url_data_selector option removed (replaced by slide_data_selectors).
* caption_data_selector option removed (replaced by slide_data_selectors).
* link_url_data_selector option removed (replaced by slide_data_selectors).
* effect_data_selector option removed (replaced by slide_data_selectors).
